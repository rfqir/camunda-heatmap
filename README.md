If you encounter issues running "npm install", try the following steps:

1. run "yarn install"
2. Run "npm install --legacy-peer-deps" if the default command doesn't work.
3. If that still doesn't work, you can use "npm install --force". However, this is not recommended as it might cause unexpected issues.
